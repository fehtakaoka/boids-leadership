# Boids

Boids is a program, initially developped by Craig Reynolds, inteded to simulate the flocking behaviour of birds. It's commonly used in computer graphics providing realistic behaviour of schools of fish or herds of animals (besides birds).

This processing implementation aims to introduce the effect of change in leadership described by Hartman and Benes. However, it doesn't exactly replicates the proposed algorithm. It has been slightly modified in the eccentricity definition (see ...) and in the cange in velocity of the new leader.

Other functionalities have also been added. The environment dynamics include obstacle avoidance, wander behaviour, flow field, predator seek and flee, most of which have been described by Reynolds. It is also possible to adjust the environment dynamic parameters by buttons and sliders and visualizing the corresponding effect.


## Requirements 
* Processing 3

## Functionalities
The graphical interface have two pannels: the left one activates different options whereas the right one adjusts some of the algorithms' parameters.
